## Introduction
Welcome to BenFa, a challenging portfolio project of the ALX software engineering foundation, In this blog I will explain to you the purpose of BenFa.
## The team 
  I developed BenFa project portfolio on my own, which is an individual challenge, so I took full responsibility to do the entire project myself.
## Who BenFa created for: 
BenFa was created for all people of all ages and genders, to help them live a better life especially in our continent Africa, although there are a lot of e-commerce projects in the world üåé but BenFa is a little special.
 ## My personal focus: 
I focused on the entire project because all parts are important but now i focused  more in the orders and payment parts because they're need more security and details.
Why to choose work on BenFa: 
Oddly enough, I was a bit scared of e-commerce, to buy or sell something, but my sister makes me change the idea, and she encouraged me to think in a positive way and bring this idea and work in it.
## What I accomplished with BenFa: 
In the frontend part: I used HTML, styling with css and javascript and used some icons from bootstrap.
In the backend part: I used MYSQL for database operation and Flask,so together for data management and to powered my project BenFa.
Feature: I will gonna work in the soon future to make BenFa responsive and compatible with mobile to make the users access it from a mobile view.
Lessons learned and Growth achieved: 
I gained more skills while working in BenFa and patience, and what I learned is how to work with projects and that I have to follow the program I did step by step in order to achieve a good result.
## Conclusion:
BenFa is so precious to me, starting with the name ‚Äúit‚Äôs a melange of my parents' names‚Äù and also a challenge I take it personally.
